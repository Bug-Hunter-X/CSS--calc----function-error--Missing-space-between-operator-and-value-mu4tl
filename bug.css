The following CSS code snippet uses the `calc()` function incorrectly, leading to unexpected results:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  /* Incorrect: Missing space between the operator and the value */
}
```

The correct syntax requires a space between the operator (`-`) and the numeric value (`10px`):

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  /* Correct: Added space between the operator and the value */
}
```

Failing to include this space can cause the `calc()` function to parse the expression incorrectly, resulting in unexpected element widths. This is a common oversight but can be easily fixed by paying attention to spacing within the `calc()` function's parentheses.
